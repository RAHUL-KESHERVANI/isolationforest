# Isolation Forest

In this section, we will discuss how to use the Isolation Forest to find anomalies in a dataset and how to interpret the results.

## Notebooks

* [Isolation Forest Deep Dive](isolation-forest.ipynb): This notebook describes how the Isolation Forest algorithm works and how to use it.
* [Interpreting Isolation Forest Anomalies](interpreting_isolation-forest.ipynb): This notebook describes how to understand why a particular feature is considered an anomaly.
